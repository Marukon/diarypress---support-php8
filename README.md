DiaryPress is a plugin made by Tom Howson designed to allow your blog to operate like a diary. It will disable RSS feeds to keep your blog private and ask you to login in order to access the content. This is handy even if you run your diary on a local web server such as WAMP as it protects your blog against nosey family and friends.

My code is based on diarypress 5.3 and make some changes to support php8.
